    "Jim and Anne will be in charge of the spring field day to be held in early June. They will ask their friends' aid to get set up. There will be games for the boys and girls. The children will want to hike, ride their bikes, and swim. This yearly event will be held in the new Peach Grove Park. Ruth has work to do on the plans for food for the day. Last year Ruth spent most of her time helping the two cooks with many snacks. Hot dogs, fries, soft drinks, ice cream, and candy apples were big sellers. Apple pie and ice cream sold well too.",
    "I hope Ruth serves the same food this year. George Long will hire the band and singer for the day. A great jazz band will play. George's mom leads the group. The jazz band is sure to be one of the big hits. George is to have them play from one to four and also in the evening. The fine songs they will play are sure to please all of us. Nice gifts will be given to all of the winners in each of the events. Local news coverage will include television and newspapers. Joyce Scott will take care of the pictures for the school paper and yearbook. Maybe the national news will do a short story on the tenth annual spring field day.",
    "On a standard keyboard for English speakers the home row keys are: ASDF for the left hand and JKL; for the right hand. The keyboard is called a QWERTY keyboard because these are the first six letters on the keyboard. Most modern computer keyboards have a raised dot or bar on the home keys for the index fingers to help touch typists maintain and rediscover the correct position on the keyboard quickly with no need to look at the keys. More recently, the ability to touch type on touchscreen phones has been made possible with the use of specialized virtual keyboard software for touch typing."
